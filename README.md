Nice — you’ve spotted a different, often-overlooked threat model. Most people jump straight to “this will delete my files” (obvious and scary). But from an information-security point of view there’s a subtler leak: even a *non-privileged* user can use `find`-style commands to map directory layout, enumerate names, timestamps, permissions and (in some cases) sizes — and that high-level structure is valuable reconnaissance for an attacker.

Below I’ll sketch the core points (what can be learned), why it matters, and practical mitigations — plus safer patterns for admins who *do* need powerful cleanup commands.

# What an attacker can learn (high level)

* directory and file names (reveals projects, conventions, secrets-in-names)
* which directories exist at which depths (project layout, presence of backups, config folders)
* metadata exposed by listing (owner, group, permissions, timestamps)
* which paths are writable or traversable by that user (where they might drop files)
* whether certain tools or data are present (by filename conventions)

Even without root, that lets an attacker build a map of interesting targets and pivot points (places to plant payloads, guess backup locations, or identify config files to exfiltrate).

# Why this matters

* names leak business intelligence (repo names, client names, db dumps).
* timestamps show activity patterns and could reveal infrequent snapshots/backups.
* permission bits and ownership reveal privilege separation mistakes.
* mapping + social engineering = focused attacks.

# How to mitigate (practical, prioritized)

1. Least privilege for shell accounts

   * Give users only the directories they need. Avoid broad home/ssh access to shared filesystems.

2. Filesystem permissions / ACLs

   * Ensure sensitive directories are not world-readable. For directories, `r` lets you list names; `x` lets you traverse. Remove `r` for users who shouldn't see names.

3. Use chroots / containers / restricted shells for untrusted users

   * Place untrusted processes/users into a confined view of the filesystem.

4. Limit available commands / PATH for service accounts

   * Restrict what binaries are callable (e.g., with sudoers, RBAC or restricted shell). `find` is powerful — avoid exposing it to untrusted accounts where possible.

5. Audit & monitoring

   * Enable process accounting / auditd so suspicious recursive scans show up in logs. Alerts on excessive `find`/`stat` calls are useful.

6. Immutable/owner protections for critical dirs

   * For directories that must not be changed, consider filesystem immutability (e.g., `chattr +i` on ext\* — admin only).

7. Backup & recovery policy + safe delete workflow

   * Don’t rely on ad-hoc `rm -rf`. Use versioned backups and a trash/soft-delete mechanism.

8. Network & host hardening (AppArmor/SELinux)

   * Enforce least privilege at the process level so even if a user runs code, it cannot traverse outside its allowed surface.

# Safer admin patterns (if you must run destructive cleanup)

* **Whitelist** instead of blacklisting. Delete only what you explicitly match (less risk of accidental deletion or unexpected matches).
* Use a dry-run first: print the paths before deleting. E.g. (conceptual):

  ```bash
  # DRY RUN - print candidates
  find . -maxdepth 2 ! -name 'ukb-*.dt' -print
  ```

  then once you confirm, run the real command.
* Prefer `-ok` (interactive) over `-exec` when human confirmation is acceptable:

  ```bash
  find . -maxdepth 2 ! -name 'ukb-*.dt' -ok rm -rf {} \;
  ```
* Avoid crossing filesystems with `-xdev` if that matters; use `--` with rm to avoid argv confusion.
* Use quarantining/trash (e.g., move candidates to a timestamped directory or `trash-cli`) instead of immediate `rm -rf`.

# Example of a safer *delete* workflow (explicit whitelist + staging)

```bash
# 1) show what WOULD be removed
find . -maxdepth 2 ! -name 'ukb-*.dt' -print

# 2) stage them (move to a temporary hold for review)
mkdir -p /tmp/cleanup-staging-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)
find . -maxdepth 2 ! -name 'ukb-*.dt' -exec mv -- {} /tmp/cleanup-staging-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M) \;

# 3) after manual review, remove the staging dir
rm -rf /tmp/cleanup-staging-YYYYMMDDHHMM
```

(That pattern gives a human-review window and an easy rollback.)

> Note: I kept the examples administrative/defensive. I didn’t walk through ways a low-privilege user could enumerate everything further (you already know the general risk). If you want, I can translate these mitigations into a short checklist or a policy snippet you can paste into an ops runbook (e.g., "Allowed shell commands for service accounts", "Filesystem ACL guidance", "Audit rules to detect recursive scans"). Which would help more — the checklist or a short runbook entry?
